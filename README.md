# LIRI-For-SIRI

### Liri language recognition node app
With this node app you can easly search through the terminal for various information.
* Spotify songs (spotify-this-song)
* IMBD Movie information (movie-this)
* Concert Events (concert-this)
* Read from a .txt File (do-what-it-says)

please see this video for a demo of my app.

### Append searched results to a log.txt file
I was able to pull all the information from the search and append into a file.
